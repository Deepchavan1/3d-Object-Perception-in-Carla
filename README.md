# Integration of 3D Object Detection (RTM3D) in carla using carla-ros-bridge
## 3d Object Detection
For implementing 3D object detecion, [RTM3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03343) have been used. The implementation of this paper is referred from [here](https://github.com/maudzung/RTM3D). The model has been trained and pretrained model has been used for implementing 3D object detection in carla.
## Carla-ros-bridge
Installation of carla can be referred from [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start_quickstart/). Now, install ros noetic for ubuntu. Follow [this](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) for installing ros depending upon your requirements. Further for integration carla-ros-bridge refer [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ros_documentation/).
